It's finally time to start training models!\n\nThe first step is to split the data into a training set and a test set. Some labels don't occur very often, but we want to make sure that they appear in both the training and the test sets. We provide a function that will make sure at least `min_count` examples of each label appear in each split: `multilabel_train_test_split`.\n\nFeel free to check out the full code for `multilabel_train_test_split` [here](https://github.com/drivendataorg/box-plots-sklearn/blob/master/src/data/multilabel.py).\n\nYou'll start with a simple model that uses **just the numeric columns** of your DataFrame when calling `multilabel_train_test_split`. The data has been read into a DataFrame `df` and a list consisting of just the numeric columns is available as `NUMERIC_COLUMNS`.\n\n### Instructions\n- Create a new DataFrame named `numeric_data_only` by applying the `.fillna(-1000)` method to the numeric columns (available in the list `NUMERIC_COLUMNS`) of `df`.\n- Convert the labels (available in the list `LABELS`) to dummy variables. Save the result as `label_dummies`.\n- In the call to `multilabel_train_test_split()`, set the `size` of your test set to be `0.2`. Use a `seed` of `123`.\n- Fill in the `.info()` method calls for `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`.",

This is called the \"holdout data.\"\n\nThe point of the holdout data is to provide a fair test for machine learning competitions.

Often, tokens are separated by whitespace. But we can specify other delimiters as well. For example, if we decided to tokenize on punctuation, then any punctuation mark would be treated like a whitespace. How we tokenize text in our DataFrame can affect the statistics we use in our model.\n\nA particular cell in our budget DataFrame may have the string content `Title I - Disadvantaged Children/Targeted Assistance`. The number of n-grams generated by this text data is sensitive to whether or not we tokenize on punctuation, as you'll show in the following exercise.\n\nHow many tokens (1-grams) are in the string\n\n`Title I - Disadvantaged Children/Targeted Assistance`\nif we tokenize on whitespace and punctuation?\n\n**Possible Answers**\n\n(1) 4\n<span style='color:Green'>**(2) 6**</span>\n(3) 8\n(4) 13\n\nComment: Yes!
